# Number-Guessing-Game-Using-C

/* We will write a program that genrates a random number and asks the player to guess if. If the player guess is higher than actual number, 
the program displays "Lower number please". Similarly, If the user guess is too low, the program prints "Higher number please".
When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number. 
HINT: use loop & use a random number genrator. */
